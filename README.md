AnyHash
=======

AnyHash is a password "storage" solution. However:

* There is no need to save passwords in any way.
* A password can always be generated from you master password and the site you need it for.
* As a result, there is no password store, that could fall into the wrong hands or you have to carry with you.
* The resulting passwords have a high strength, even if your master-password is weak.
* It is easy and convenient; extensions for browsers may follow to further improve this point.
* It runs in any browser, which supports JavaScript.

It uses a JavaScript version of the famous scrypt algorithm to create passwords.
Currently the application can be hosted on web servers or be used as a mobile app.
